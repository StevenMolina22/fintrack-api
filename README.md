# Fintrack API Documentation

## Overview

The **Fintrack API** is a robust, scalable, and modern RESTful API designed to empower users to manage their financial lives effectively. Built with Go, Fiber, and Turso (LibSQL), this project provides a comprehensive backend solution for tracking income, expenses, assets, liabilities, budgets, and financial goals. Whether you're a developer looking to contribute to a cutting-edge project, a recruiter seeking talent with real-world experience, or a client in need of a reliable financial management system, this API offers a professional-grade foundation.

This documentation highlights the system's architecture, features, and extensibility, showcasing its value to technical and non-technical stakeholders alike.

## Project Highlights

### Why This Project Stands Out

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Go and Fiber for high performance, paired with Turso (LibSQL) for lightweight, scalable database management.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows RESTful principles with a modular design, making it easy to maintain, extend, and scale.
- **Real-World Relevance**: Addresses everyday financial management needs, from budgeting to goal tracking, appealing to both end-users and businesses.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Well-documented codebase with SQLC-generated queries, reducing boilerplate and ensuring type safety.
- **Recruiter Appeal**: Demonstrates proficiency in backend development, database design, and API engineering—skills in high demand.

## Features

### Implemented Functionalities

- **User Management**: CRUD operations for user accounts with Clerk integration for authentication-ready design.
- **Transaction Management**: Track income and expenses with categorization and detailed metadata.
- **Category Management**: Organize transactions with customizable categories.
- **Asset & Liability Tracking**: Monitor financial health by managing assets and liabilities.
- **Budget Management**: Set and track budgets tied to categories with time-bound constraints.
- **Goal Management**: Define and monitor financial goals with user-specific progress tracking.

### Future Roadmap

- **Reporting & Analytics**: Generate insights like income vs. expenses, category spending, and net worth trends.
- **Authentication**: Integrate full JWT or OAuth2-based security.
- **Pagination & Filtering**: Enhance API usability with advanced query options.
- **Goal Progress Tracking**: Add detailed progress endpoints for richer goal management.

- **Users**: `id`, `clerk_id`, `is_active`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Transactions**: `id`, `user_id`, `category_id`, `name`, `amount`, `description`, `type`, `date`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Categories**: `id`, `name`, `description`
- **Budgets**: `id`, `category_id`, `amount`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- **Assets**: `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `amount`
- **Liabilities**: `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `amount`
